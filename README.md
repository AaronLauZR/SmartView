# SmartView
This is my final year project for the year 2023 at Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology. SmartView is a mobile application designed for community and locality sharing. With this app, users will be able to read news and local posts published by other users. Additionally, they can search for nearby shops based on their current location in Malaysia.
